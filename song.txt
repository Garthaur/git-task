Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?
(Can you feel my heart?)

(Can you feel my heart?)

I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling, to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

(Can you feel my heart?)

Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?
